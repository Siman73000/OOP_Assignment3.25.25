# OOP Assignment 3/25/25 Instructions

"Write a class and methods by considering real-world scenarios. Just explain them; do not write code"

## Class & Method Details

The calc.py file details a class with methods used to calculate two numbers in four simple algebraic ways; addition, multiplication, and division.

Below is the submission of this assignment that passes all requirements regarding the instructions.

## Submission

The class is made to process two numbers and perform one of four operations; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class as a whole is names "Calculator". The first method is defined as a constructor method with "self" being passed into this method. It then, by default, sets the result to zero thus making it the constructor. The second method is defined as "add" to which "self", "a", and "b" are being passed into it. "add" sets the result to "a" plus "b", then it returns the result. The third method is defined as "subtract" and has "self", "a", and "b" being passed into it. "subtract" then sets the result to "a" minus "b" and returns the result. The fourth method is defined as "multiply" to which "self", "a", and "b" are being passed into it. "multiply" then sets the result to "a" multiplied by "b" and returns the result. The final method is defined as "divide" and has "self", "a", and "b" as passed values. "divide" then sets the result to "a" divided by "b" and returns the result.
